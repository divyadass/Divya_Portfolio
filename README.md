### [Project-1: Sarcasm detection using LSTM](https://github.com/divyadass/sarcasm_detection/blob/develop/NLP_Project_Sarcasm_Detection_Questions.ipynb)
- Data used: News Headlines data
- Model architecture: Bidirectional LSTM
- Framework used: Keras with Tensorflow
- Hardware: CPU is sufficient
- Git branch: 
  1. develop : Jupyter notebook demonstrating model training
  2. depolyment : flask API making use of the trained model to make predictions

### [Project-2: Named Entity recognition](https://github.com/divyadass/NER/blob/develop_BERT/NLP_NER_via_BERT.ipynb)
- Data used: CONLL data
- Model architecture: 1. CRF 2. Transformers
- Framework used: 1. sklearn_crfsuite 2. BERT - PyTorch
- Hardware: 1. CPU is sufficient 2. Google Colab's GPU
- Git branch: 1. develop_CRF 2. develop_BERT

### [Project-3: Face-recognition using the classic PCA algorithm](https://github.com/divyadass/Face-Recognition/blob/master/ML%20face%20recognition%20with%20PCA.ipynb)
- Data used: Images of the students enrolled in the course
- Implimented the code in python from scratch 

### [Blog-1: Generating recommendations using HRNN](https://medium.com/@divyadass11/the-benefits-and-reasons-for-using-session-based-setting-to-generate-recommendations-using-hrnn-9790df704dc7)
- The blog describes diferent recommendation algorithms used traditionally.
- In which setting they will work and fail.
- What advantages we get on using HRNN algorithm for the same.
